    <h3>William Huang</h3>
    <h4 style="color:DodgerBlue;">I am born as William (You Wei) Huang (just in case if you don not know my whole name), who had been in Kaohsiung American School for over 4-5 years and been (and live) to/ in various cities like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Melbourne, New York, etc.. However, I was given birth at Kaohsiung City, Taiwan on February 22, 2006. I hold an Australian nationality, which I had lived in Melbourne City, the fourth largest city in the southern hemisphere with my family. Later in the years, our family moved to New York City for a year, it was incredibly the most beautiful city that I had ever been to. Prior coming to Taiwan, we stayed in Ho Man Tin, HK for a little while, mom thought that HK is too expensive for settling down, so that my family moved to Taiwan, which is the hometown where my parents are from, and attended this school. That is where I start the milestone of becoming part of the one of the finest school in Asia. My life is fulfilled with many journeys throughout learning a second and to fourth languages, including English, Japanese, and Cantonese. I would like to decipher my passions to you the viewers and to have a chance to get to know each other better. I am born to have one ear that can not  hear anything, so I must install on the cochlear to help me hear better. This makes me look more like a normal person, who can hear the same thing through the same ear. That is the beginning to realize how important are my ears.  I believe so, I am kind of like a hypocrite, showing two sides of me, being an introvert, and being bright. Sometimes, you would know me as an introvert, when I am new to something or met new classmates, I would be usually nervous and shy, but as the time progresses, I would be more comfortable showing my bright side. Although I like making new friends and expressing my passions to them, also I have the ability to check to see if the friend is toxic or not. For me, having friends can help make learning more interesting and collaborate intensively, lastly becoming better communicators to make the school even more interesting. I can say that I have three good passions, drawing pictures, I indeed love drawing pictures, I would try to plan my drawing via the internet and follow along with the youtube tutorial. It is kind of fun when you get to move in with your hands and spread your own creativity without verbal communication. This benefits me a lot when writing creativity stories, I can actually design a story from the picture in words, inspirations from the other artists are really important in this case, which it can let me evaluate my own skills. My second passion would probably be writing essays with an unlimited subject, I love using the magic of our brains and creativity in my essay to let the readers have a clear image in their mind. To wrap up, my third passion would be geography and history. They are one of my all-time favorite school subjects, I could easily recap the capital of the country, and a few histories from some societies, like Jewish, the ancient chinese, etc. By all means, I try to be open-minded when trying new things, however, I have some dislikes, such as math, I am a little bit impatient to sit down and solve the problem one bit by bit, and sometimes it makes me stuck on one problem for 20 minutes. It rarely allows me to use my creativity and skills so much, all I have to do is to follow the instructions stated. That is kind of tedious for me, who would like to express more about my self-esteem. I also have an aversion or dislikes to seafood, I am not adapt to its weird ocean taste, and plus I am a little bit allergic to it. So if you were to give me seafood, I would have to shook my head and say no. I barely have no allergies to any food, except seafood. My allergies are not edible, like pollution, cotton, dust, etc.. I also dislike sports, although one of the mission statement balanced stated to be balanced either with academics, arts, athletics. I really can not stand athletics, it only just allow you become sweaty, sick from heatstroke, sore from jumping up and down. In my opinion, that all terrible disadvantages may arise once playing sports. For this website, I am the chief editor for both contents and the coding, I'm excited to share my ethicnity of being a Taiwanese with the vivid contents covered in our website!</h4>
