Construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004. The tower has served as an icon of modern Taiwan ever since its opening. The building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and Asian tradition. Its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments. The tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes. A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores, restaurants and clubs. 2004 to present, fireworks launched from Taipei 101 feature prominently in international New Year's Eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media.

Symbolism and Design
Even the neighborhood and sculptures in the park surrounding Taipei 101 are meant to support the tower's feng shui and to prevent positive energy from escaping. From the shape of entrances to curving surfaces and colors, the landmark is designed to symbolize prosperity and good fortune.

To some onlookers, Taipei 101 looks like a stack of Western-style Chinese food carryout boxes (traditional oyster pails), however, the tower is meant to represent a stalk of bamboo reaching into the sky to connect heaven and earth.

The 101 floors represent adding one to the number 100, which is considered perfect and auspicious in Chinese culture. The eight sections of the tower are a nod to the auspicious number eight, which represents abundance and good fortune in Chinese culture.

Because four is considered an unlucky number in superstition, having a 44th floor was purposely avoided by creating a floor 42a to bump the 43rd floor into that position.
