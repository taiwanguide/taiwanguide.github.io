<h1> <font face = "georgia"> 1. Taipei 101 -- One of the Tallest Structure in 21st century!</h1> </font>
<h2>Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan</h2>
<p> <font face = "courier new"> 
The Taipei 101 or TAIPEI 101 (depending on how you call it), formerly known as the Taipei World Financial Center – is a landmark supertall skyscraper in Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan. The building was officially classified as the world's tallest in 2004, and remained such until the completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2010. In 2011, the building was awarded the LEED platinum certification, the highest award according to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, and became the tallest and largest green building in the world. It used to have the fastest elevator in the world, traveling at 60.6 km/h (37.7 mph) and transporting passengers from the 5th to 89th floor in 37 seconds. In 2016, the title for the fastest elevator was given to the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai.

Construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004. The tower has served as an icon of modern Taiwan ever since its opening. The building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and Asian tradition. Its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments. The tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes. A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores, restaurants and clubs. 2004 to present, fireworks launched from Taipei 101 feature prominently in international New Year's Eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media.

Taipei 101 is owned by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. The name that was originally planned for the building, Taipei World Financial Center, until 2003, was derived from the name of the owner. 

A few Taipei 101 facts surprise people, but none more than the existence of Summit 101 -- a "secret" VIP club purported to exist on the 101st floor of the building.

The Taipei 101 tower in Taipei, Taiwan, was the world's tallest building from 2004 until 2010 when it was beaten out by Dubai's impressive Burj Khalifa. Even the 2015-2016 New Year's Eve firework's show was nature themed.

Rich with symbolism and tradition, Taipei's iconic landmark is a standing monument to ancient feng shui traditions and modern architecture.

Symbolism and Design
Even the neighborhood and sculptures in the park surrounding Taipei 101 are meant to support the tower's feng shui and to prevent positive energy from escaping. From the shape of entrances to curving surfaces and colors, the landmark is designed to symbolize prosperity and good fortune.

To some onlookers, Taipei 101 looks like a stack of Western-style Chinese food carryout boxes (traditional oyster pails), however, the tower is meant to represent a stalk of bamboo reaching into the sky to connect heaven and earth.

The 101 floors represent adding one to the number 100, which is considered perfect and auspicious in Chinese culture. The eight sections of the tower are a nod to the auspicious number eight, which represents abundance and good fortune in Chinese culture.

Because four is considered an unlucky number in superstition, having a 44th floor was purposely avoided by creating a floor 42a to bump the 43rd floor into that position.
