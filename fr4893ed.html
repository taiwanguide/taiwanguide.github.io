<h1> 1. Taipei 101 -- One of the Tallest Structure in 21st century!</h1>
<h2>Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan</h2>
<p class = 'italic'>The Taipei 101 or TAIPEI 101 (depending on how you call it), formerly known as the Taipei World Financial Center â€“ is a landmark supertall skyscraper in Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan. The building was officially classified as the world's tallest in 2004, and remained such until the completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2010. In 2011, the building was awarded the LEED platinum certification, the highest award according to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, and became the tallest and largest green building in the world. It used to have the fastest elevator in the world, traveling at 60.6 km/h (37.7 mph) and transporting passengers from the 5th to 89th floor in 37 seconds. In 2016, the title for the fastest elevator was given to the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai.

Construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004. The tower has served as an icon of modern Taiwan ever since its opening. The building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and Asian tradition. Its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments. The tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes. A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores, restaurants and clubs. 2004 to present, fireworks launched from Taipei 101 feature prominently in international New Year's Eve broadcasts and the structure appears frequently in travel literature and international media.

Taipei 101 is owned by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. The name that was originally planned for the building, Taipei World Financial Center, until 2003, was derived from the name of the owner. </p>

<h1> 2. Taroko Gorge National Park</h1>
<h2>Xincheng, Hualien </h2>
<p class = 'italic'>Taiwan is a mountainous island situated in a subtropical zone. The Tropic of Cancer cuts through the middle of the island, dividing the temperate and tropical climates zones. In addition, southwest airflows and typhoons during summer and the northeast seasonal winds during winter bring an abundance of rain. Together with its diversified topographic features, the island boasts an environment that is special and interesting both in terms of ecology and evolution sense.

Taroko National Park's boundaries include the mouth of Liwu River close to sea level, and also the highest point, Mount Nanhu, which stands at 3,742 meters. This huge difference of altitude within the park provides the visitor with the pleasure of experiencing obvious climate changes along the Central Cross-Island Highway. Subtropical to high altitude vegetation can be observed during a single trip. The visitor is rewarded with captivating experiences brought about by seasonal changes and altitude difference. 

The vegetation of Taroko National Park includes broadleaved forests, mixed broadleaved and coniferous forests; subalpine coniferous forests cover areas above 3000 meters in elevation. Plant communities found in areas with underlying limestone and areas of high elevations are composed of distinctive species. The rich topographic features and diversified vegetation of the park bring about a variety of habitats in which many life forms thrive. Research indicates that one-third of the vascular plants-found in Taiwan can be found within the park. Half the species of mammals found in Taiwan are also present here. In addition, ninety percent of the resident species of birds in Taiwan , and over half of the butterfly species can also be encountered in the park.
