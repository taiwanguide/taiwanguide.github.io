Forms Of Governments Powtoon Video
In the past few weeks, we were introduced to the Ancient Greek government as the first unit of the year. The forms of governments of Greece are Monarchy, Tyranny, Oligarchy, and finally Democracy. Here is a recap of one of each government â€“

Monarchy â€“ A government that consists king and (women were not allowed to be part of the monarchy, but in British culture, the queen is committed).

Oligarchy â€“ A government that consists of a few people ruling (3-5 people)

Tyranny â€“ A government that consists only one person who has all the power (check the video to see what the differences between Monarchy and Tyranny ðŸ™‚ )

Democracy â€“ A government that allows everyone to have the right to propose a new idea, argue, or declare war, etcâ€¦ Everyone has the power to change the regulation.

 

For more informationâ€¦

Please check the powtoon video that, explains the decline of each government and how that led to a change of government. Below is my powtoon â€“



 

SEPTEMBER 4, 2018
GRADE 7, INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETIES

EDIT
Introduction v.3. 2018-2019
I am born as William (You Wei) Huang (just in case if you donâ€™t know my whole name), who had been in Kaohsiung American School for over 4-5 years and been (and live) to/ in various cities like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Melbourne, New York, etc.. However, I was given birth at Kaohsiung City, Taiwan on February 22, 2006. I hold an Australian nationality, which I had lived in Melbourne City, the fourth largest city in the southern hemisphere with my family. Later in the years, our family moved to New York City for a year, it was incredibly the most beautiful city that I had ever been to. Prior coming to Taiwan, we stayed in Ho Man Tin ä½•æ–‡ç”°, HK for a little while, mom thought that HK is too expensive for settling down, so that my family moved to my parentâ€™s hometown Taiwan, and attended this school. Thatâ€™s where I start the milestone of becoming part of the one of the finest school in Asia. My life is fulfilled with many journeys throughout learning a second and to fourth languages, including English, Japanese, and Cantonese. In this letter, I would like to decipher my passions to you and to have a chance to get to know each other better and my summer vacation as well. I am born to have one ear that canâ€™t hear anything, so I must install on the cochlear to help me hear better. This makes me look more like a normal person, who can hear the same thing through the same ear. Thatâ€™s the beginning to realize how important is my ears.  I believe so, I am kind of like a hypocrite, showing two sides of me, being an introvert, and being bright. Sometimes, you would know me as an introvert, when I am new to something or met new classmates, I would be usually nervous and shy, but as the time progresses, I would be more comfortable showing my bright side. Although I like making new friends and expressing my passions to them, also I have the ability to check to see if the friend is toxic or not. For me, having friends can help make learning more interesting and collaborate intensively, lastly becoming better communicators to make the school even more interesting. I can say that I have three good passions, drawing pictures, I indeed love drawing pictures, I would try to plan my drawing via the internet and follow along with the youtube tutorial. Itâ€™s kind of fun when you get to move in with your hands and spread your own creativity without â€˜verbal communicationâ€™. This benefits me a lot when writing creativity stories, I can actually design a story from the picture in words, inspirations from the other artists are really important in this case, which it can let me evaluate my own skills. My second passion would probably be writing essays with an unlimited subject, I love using the magic of our brains and creativity in my essay to let the readers have a clear image in their mind. To wrap up, my third passion would be geography and history. They are one of my all-time favorite school subjects, I could easily recap the capital of the country, and a few histories from some societies, like Jewish, China, etcâ€¦ By all means, I try to be open-minded when trying new things, however, I have some dislikes, such as math, I am a little bit impatient to sit down and solve the problem one bit by bit, and sometimes it makes me stuck on one problem for 20 minutes. It rarely allows me to use my creativity and skills so much, all I have to do is to follow the instructions stated. Thatâ€™s kind of tedious for me, who would like to express more about my self-esteem. I also have an aversion (dislike) to seafood, I am not adapt to its weird ocean taste, and plus I am a little bit allergic to it. So if you were to give me seafood, I would have to shook my head and say â€˜noâ€™. I barely have no allergies to any food, except seafood. My allergies are not edible, like pollution, cotton, dust, etc.. I also dislike sports, although unity of the mission statement â€˜balancedâ€™ stated to be balanced either with academics, arts, athletics. I really canâ€™t stand athletics, they only just let you become sweaty, heatstroke, sore from jumping up and down. In my opinion, that all terrible disadvantages may arise once playing sports. To add on, I hate playing computer games, there is a waste of time, and doesnâ€™t benefit myself at all, gamers viewing this ðŸ˜‰ shall start striving to release from the addiction, itâ€™ll help you so much, I promise. 

â€”

All in all, I am very excited to be communicating all Kaohsiung American School bloggers, sharing everyoneâ€™s unique soul into one category in the website directoryâ€¦..
